strptime-php
=======================

An implementation of strptime in PHP.

Why reinvent the wheel?
-----------------------

This is useful for non-POSIX systems like Windows.
You could use it your local workstation is on Windows,
and your servers are on UNIX.
Especially if you are too lazy too install Cygwin. ;-)
