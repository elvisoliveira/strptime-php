strptime-php
=======================

An implementation of strptime in PHP.

Currently, the function is not complete et definitely not optimized.
But it works with a lot of usual cases.

Why reinvent the wheel?
-----------------------

This is useful for non-POSIX systems like Windows.
You could use it if your local workstation is on Windows,
and your servers are on UNIX.
Especially if you are too lazy too install Cygwin. ;-)

Be aware it is a dev tool.
You should not use it on a Windows production server.
